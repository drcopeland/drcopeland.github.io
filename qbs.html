<h1> The Classical and Quantum Base Size. </h1>

<h3> 0. Guess the permutation! </h3>

<p> Suppose $G$ is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_group">permutation group</a> acting on a set $\Omega$. An oracle is hiding a certain
permutation $\pi$ belonging to $G$, and your goal is to figure out what is $\pi$, by asking the
oracle questions. More precisely, "questioning the oracle" means choosing any $x \in \Omega$ and
as an input to the oracle, who responds with $\pi(x)$.

<br><br>

Hopefully, by asking enough questions, you can eventually figure out $\pi$!<br><br>

<b>Example.</b> Take $\Omega = \{1,2, \dots, n\}$ and let $G = S_n$ be the nth 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_group">symmetric group</a>. An oracle
is hiding some permutation $\pi \in G$ which is unknown to you. You're allowed to pick a number $i \in \{1, \dots, n\}$ and use this
input to query the oracle. How do you figure out $\pi$?
